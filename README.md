# SwiftDiningPhilosophers
Dining philosophers problem Algorithm implemented in Swift (concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them using GCD and Semaphore in Swift)

# from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem

In computer science, the dining philosophers problem is an example problem often used in concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them.

It was originally formulated in 1965 by Edsger Dijkstra as a student exam exercise, presented in terms of computers competing for access to tape drive peripherals. Soon after, Tony Hoare gave the problem its present formulation.

This Swift implementation is based on the Chandy/Misra solution and it use GCD Dispatch and Semaphone on Swift cross platform
